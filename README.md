# ModelingInformationSystemsProject
This is one of my projects from the second year of studies. 
It is not complete project, because requirements for the course were UML project with partial implementation in Java. 
This is only implementation.

There are a lot of things wrong in this implementation, 
some of them were discovered when I finished it, so it was too late to refactor.
